Explanation of what git clone does (in my own words)

There are 2 ways to create a local repository. The first is to create it manually in terminal (using “git init”). The second is to “clone” (or copy) a remote repository from a host (like GitHub), thereby creating a new local repository which is an exact copy of the remote repository.

The cloning process is sometimes referred to as being in the “downstream” direction relative to the local repository (information is “down-streamed” from the host to the local machine).

To clone a repository, first copy the “clone url” from the remote repository host (preferably using the SSH address which is more secure, rather than the HTML one).

Next, type the following command in terminal (while positioned in the relevant location in the file system where the cloned local repository is to be placed):

git clone <url address>

Executing this command will create a local repository folder which is an exact copy of the remote repository.

By default, the cloned local repository folder will have the same name as the remote original. However, it is possible to change that name by adding a new name at the end of the clone command:

git clone <url address> <new name for local repository>
