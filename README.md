<h3>Makers | Week 2 | Challenge</h3>

Create a repo and add three new files to the 'master' branch named:
- branch
- git clone
- upstream remote

Each of these files should include a question about the specific term it refers to.

Then create a new branch called 'answers' and include an explanation about each term in your own words.
