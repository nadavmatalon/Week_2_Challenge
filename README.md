##Makers Academy | Week 2 | Challenge | Part I


This repo contians my answer to __Week 2 Friday Challange (Part I)__ as part 
of the course at [Makers Academy](http://www.makersacademy.com/).

The goal of this challange was to continue practicing working with 
[Github](http://github.com)

A summary of the guidelines for this challange:

* Create a repo and add three new files to the 'master' branch named:
  - branch 
  - git clone
  - upstream remote

* Each of these files should include a question about the specific term it refers to.

* create a new branch called 'answers' and include an explanation about each term in your 
  own words.
