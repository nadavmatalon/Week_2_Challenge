Explanation of what the term "upstream" remote is usually used for (in my own words)

The term “upstream” is typically used to describe the direction of data flow between local and remote repositories relative to a particular repository.

(note that a single local repo may have multiple remote repos linked to it).

(Also, the default name given by Git to the remote repo from which the local repo was cloned is “origin”)

In this context, when information is pushed from a local repo to a remote repo, the pushing process is taken to represent movement in the “upstream” direction. 

Generally speaking, when pulling or cloning from a remote repo to a local one, this is seen as “down streaming” from the perspective of the local repo.

By the same token, when pushing from the local repo to the remote repo, this is seen as “upstreaming” from the perspective of the local repo.
