Explanation of what a branch is (in my own words):

A new branch is typically created to generate an independent “line of development" which breaks off of the main development line or “trunk” at a given point. The new branch runs parallel to the main development line, and may be merged back to the main line later on. 

The purpose of creating a new branch is to preserve the integrity of the main development line (or “trunk”).

To get a list of existing branches in a local repository, go into the repo folder in terminal and type:

git branch


To create a new branch:

git branch <new_branch_name>


To switch between branches:

git checkout <branch_name>


To delete a branch (Git will prevent deletion if there are unmerged changes in that branch):

git branch -d <branch_name>


To force the deletion of a brach with unmerged changes:

git branch -D <branch_name>


To rename the current active branch:

git branch -m <branch>
